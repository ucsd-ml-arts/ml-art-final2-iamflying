# Final Project

Zijian Ding, zding@ucsd.edu

## Abstract Proposal

Our final project is to "make up" a classic movie scene Titanic - "I'm Flying" with style transfer and generative audio. It can be seen as a revisit of both Project 3 - Generative Audio and Project 4 - Generative Visual. The style transfer and generative audio will be conducted by GAN and DeepVoice3 model respectively. We hope to provide a new look of the movie scene: we will test different style type and audio model and select the best one. We will play this scene next Wednesday in the final project presentations.

## Project Report

Upload your project report (4 pages) as a pdf with your repository, following this template: [google docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/133H59WZBmH6MlAgFSskFLMQITeIC5d9b2iuzsOfa4E8/edit?usp=sharing).

## Model/Data

Briefly describe the files that are included with your repository:
- trained models
- training data (or link to training data)

## Code

Your code for generating your project:
- Python: generative_code.py
- Jupyter notebooks: generative_code.ipynb

## Results

Documentation of your results in an appropriate format, both links to files and a brief description of their contents:
- What you include here will very much depend on the format of your final project
  - image files (`.jpg`, `.png` or whatever else is appropriate)
  - 3d models
  - movie files (uploaded to youtube or vimeo due to github file size limits)
  - audio files
  - ... some other form

## Technical Notes

Any implementation details or notes we need to repeat your work. 
- Does this code require other pip packages, software, etc?
- Does it run on some other (non-datahub) platform? (CoLab, etc.)
